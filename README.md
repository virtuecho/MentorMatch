# Networking Companion Backend

Some guidances to perform API calls

1. The backend is running on: https://networking-companion-backend.onrender.com

2. How to call API from cloud:
Locally we will do it like this: POST http://localhost:5000/auth/register
So simply just replace the port with the link above: POST /https://networking-companion-backend.onrender.com/auth/register

3. I have set up the CORS to accept calls from http://localhost:3000 (the current local frontend port)

4. I will document all API endpoints later so you guys can have easier access!!!
